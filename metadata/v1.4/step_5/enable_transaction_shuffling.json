  "description": "AIP-27: Sender-aware shuffling enables the shuffling of transactions within a single block so that transactions from the same sender are apart from each other as much as possible. This is done to reduce the number of conflicts and re-execution during parallel execution. Our end-to-end performance benchmark show that sender-aware shuffling can improve the TPS by 25%.",
